# Placeholder for fatigue detection TensorFlow Lite model
# This file represents the trained model for driver fatigue detection
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary .tflite file
# 
# Model should be trained on facial landmark detection dataset
# Input: 128x128x1 grayscale image
# Output: 68 facial landmark coordinates
