# Placeholder for object detection TensorFlow Lite model
# This file represents the trained model for object detection
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary .tflite file
# 
# Model should be trained on automotive object detection dataset
# Input: 320x320x3 RGB image
# Output: Bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores
