# Placeholder for lane detection TensorFlow Lite model
# This file represents the trained model for lane detection
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary .tflite file
# 
# Model should be trained on lane detection dataset
# Input: 224x224x3 RGB image
# Output: Lane line coordinates and confidence scores
